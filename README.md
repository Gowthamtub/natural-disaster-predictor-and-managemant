This is clearly a **React + TypeScript + TailwindCSS** app, bundled with **Vite**. You've also got a `.bolt` folder, which suggests you're using the [Bolt AI SDK](https://bolt-ai.com/) or something similar for AI integrations. From the filenames like `PredictionForm.tsx`, `AdminPage.tsx`, and `Home.tsx`, it looks like this project involves some kind of **form-based AI prediction tool**, maybe with an admin dashboard.

### Here's a polished GitHub project description you can use as your `README.md`:
